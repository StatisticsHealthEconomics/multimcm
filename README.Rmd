> Multilevel mixture cure modelling in Stan 

The goal of `multimcm` is to jointly model two event time distributions (e.g. time to disease progression (PFS) and time to death (OS)) within a Bayesian relative survival mixture cure model framework, using the Stan engine called from R.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("StatisticsHealthEconomics/multimcm")
```

## Motivation

Mixture cure models are increasingly popular in health problems and in particular in oncology. A Bayesian paradigm allows the explicitly incorporation of uncertainties and principled synthesis of prior knowledge such as via expert elicitation or previous trials. By extending current methods to account for the dependence between event times we leverage additional information to make better inferences and decisions.

## Example


This package was originally written for this paper [Green (2025)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.70132).
